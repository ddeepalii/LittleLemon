# LittleLemon
LittleLemon is designed to provide a seamless and efficient online experience for restaurant management and customers. 
The application includes functionalities such as menu management and online reservations
This project was created as part of my Django certification to demonstrate my understanding and proficiency in building web applications using Django.

Technologies Used:-
    Framework: Django
    Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    Database: SQLite (default Django database)
    Authentication: Django's built-in authentication system


In the LittleLemon project, the ORM is used to manage the restaurant's data, such as menu items and reservations.
Templates are used to render the web pages that users interact with. This includes the home page, menu page, reservation form.
Static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images are served by Django to enhance the user interface and user experience. In the LittleLemon project, static files are used to style the web pages and add interactivity.
The Django's admin interface provides the authority to the admin to manipulate the database, add, remove, edit the menu items and users.
